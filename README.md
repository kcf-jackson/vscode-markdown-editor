# Markdown Editor â€” A full-featured WYSIWYG editor for markdown

This [editor](https://github.com/kcf-jackson/vscode-markdown-editor) is a fork of [zaaack](https://github.com/zaaack/)'s VSCode extension [vscode-markdown-editor](https://github.com/zaaack/vscode-markdown-editor/). It introduces minimal changes to support multiple editor instances and the option to set the editor as default for Markdown files. The version of [vditor](https://github.com/Vanessa219/vditor) has been updated from v3.8.4 to v3.10.9 (thanks to edits by [yuanliuus](https://github.com/yuanliuus) made [here](https://github.com/zaaack/vscode-markdown-editor/pull/102)).
